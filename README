  Fortran 2003 Interface
==========================

This package provides a Fortran 2003 compliant interface to the GLPK
package.  This interface is a thin wrapper around the C functions available
in GLPK.  Itis based on work found at:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Fortran

This interface differs significantly in that:

 1. It is more complete.
 2. Actual C pointers are used where appropriate.
 3. It is provided as a triplet of modules for USE in other codes.
 
The code is designed to work with GLPK 4.52, although it should remain
stable enough for future versions thanks to some smart decisions by the
GLPK developers.

Building
--------

The actual library code exists in the 'src' directory.  The files 
"glpk_types.f90" and "glpk_constants.f90" must be built first, then
"glpk.f90" can be built (as it depends on the earlier two).

A Simply Fortran (http://simplyfortran.com/) project has been included 
for convenience.

Using
-----

There are example programs included in the 'examples' directory.

Documentation
-------------

As of right now, there is no Fortran-specific documentation.  The C API
is relatively poorly documented as is, so it might be a while before 
anything is available.

Copyrights
----------
